# Button_To_Switch
Created By: Jmere36

Purpose: To turn a button into a switch and turn on a light (light can be removed for other output)

Instead of turning on when button is realeased it turns on when button is pressed

Removes the flicker of holding the button as well

This can add many functionalities to your build like, pressing the button to turn on a speaker system, then pressing again to turn it off

You can also monitor what state the button is in on your pc, through the serial monitor

If there's any issues or questions please contact my email at: jmere36@icloud.com
